1. Create scatter plots for the following data, make sure all the plots appear in the same
plane with x-labels and y-labels evenly spaced.

a. Create scatter plots with between (mpg-hp, mpg-weight), and (hp-mpg,
hp-time-to-60) with respect to each brand.

2. Create bar plots for the following, make sure all the plots appear in the same plane with
x-labels and y-labels evenly spaced.

a. Create a bar plot that shows the visual representation of hp, mpg, weight,
time-to-60 with respect to the number of cylinders for each of the brands.

b. Create a bar plot that shows the visual representation of hp, mpg, weight and
time-to-60 with respect to the years, for each brand.

3. Create box plots for the following:

a. Create box plots for the columns in the step1 with respect to the number of
cylinders and brand respectively.

4. Create pair plots for the entire data to study various patterns in the data.

a. Create pair plots with respect to brand, number of cylinders, year, etc.

5. Create a heatmap for the entire data to study correlation between each of the columns.

6. Create a histogram for the following:

a. Create histograms for hp, mpg, time-to-60, weight lbs, cubic inches, year, with
respect to brand.

7. Create line plots for the following:

a. Line plot between hp-mpg, hp-(time-to-60), mpg-(time-to-60), hp-weight lbs,
mpg-weight lbs, cubic inches-weight lbs
